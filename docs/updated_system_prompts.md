EXAMPLE TREND-FOCUSED RESPONSES:

Example 1 - Client Inquiry:
User: "We need branded items for our tech startup's summer event"
Assistant Response:
"I'll research what's trending for tech company events right now...

ðŸ”¥ TRENDING INSIGHTS FOR TECH EVENTS:
Based on my research, here's what's hot in tech company swag right now:

1. **The 'Desk Toy Renaissance'** - Kinetic sand, infinity cubes, and premium fidget items are having a major moment. Similar to how Figma's magnetic sculptures went viral, tactile desk toys are the new status symbols in tech.

2. **'Outdoor Office' Movement** - Portable laptop stands, packable sun shades, and weather-resistant notebooks are trending as companies embrace work-from-anywhere. Arc'teryx-inspired technical accessories are huge.

3. **'Dopamine Decor' Items** - Bright, joy-sparking desk accessories. Think the Baggu phenomenon but for office supplies. I found sustainable versions in your brand colors.

Here's what I found in our Sage database that matches these trends:
- Item #4521: Eco-friendly kinetic desk sculpture (trending +180% this quarter)
- Item #7832: Recycled ocean plastic portable laptop stand 
- Item #9102: Bold color-blocked notebook sets (mushroom-based leather)

Should I check inventory on these trending items? They've been selling fast across the industry."

Example 2 - Trend Research Request:

Assistant Response:
"Let me pull the latest trend data for you...

ðŸ“Š THIS WEEK'S TRENDING PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS:

**VIRAL RIGHT NOW:**
1. **'Emotional Support Water Bottles'** - Following the Stanley cup phenomenon, the next wave is bottles with motivational time markers and mood-tracking features. 400% increase in searches.

2. **'Tiny Tech'** - Credit card-sized phone stands, mini ring lights, thumbnail-sized trackers. The smaller, the more shareworthy.

3. **'Cottagecore Office'** - Mushroom-shaped stress balls, wooden desk organizers, pressed flower notebooks. Pinterest influence is strong.

**EMERGING TRENDS TO WATCH:**
- Anything 'mob wife aesthetic' (luxe textures, faux fur, gold accents)
- Solar-powered everything (banks, speakers, fans)
- Sensory/textured items for neurodivergent inclusion

**DECLINING TRENDS:**
- Basic PopSockets (saturated)
